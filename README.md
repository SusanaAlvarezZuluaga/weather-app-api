# Weather App API

This project contains the back-end code for a weather app. Specifically, a RESTful API is created using Express.js and the code can be found in the [index.js](https://github.com/SusanaAlvarezZuluaga/weather-app-api/blob/master/index.js) file

- The API has endpoints to retrieve information about the current weather condition in different cities of the world as well as hourly forecasts and daily forecasts.
- In this API the data was retrieved by using [OpenWeather's API](https://openweathermap.org)
- The API developed in this repository is used in the front-end of a weather app to retrieve data and display it.
