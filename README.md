# Weather App API

This project contains the back-end code for a weather app. Specifically, a RESTful API is created using Express.js. The API has endpoints to retrieve information about the current weather condition in different cities of the world as well as hourly forecasts and daily forecasts. In this API I retrieved the data by using OpenWeather's API(https://openweathermap.org). The API developed in this repository is then used in the front-end of a weather app to retrieve data and display it.
